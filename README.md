# Red Wine Quality Classification Abstract

The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting red wine quality based on physiochemical properties, using the red wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is made up of numerous chemical attributes such as density, pH, alcohol, etc. which have been correlated to wine quality. Exploratory data analysis is performance to characterize and identify potential feature relationships. Simple feature engineering strategies such as transformation of skewed distributions are conducted to improve model performance. PyCaret is leveraged in order to compare, train and optimize a classification algorithm. The tree-based classifiers, random forest and extra trees showed better performance based on Recall and F1 Score metrics. The top 3 models were blended and finalized as a reusable prediction pipeline. The developed model had a performance accuracy of nearly 70% and it was shown that rare classes identified in the model caused worsening of performance mainly due to lack of sufficient data.
